 Quantcast Coding Assignment
 
 Hello! I appreciate the time you are taking to review my code and I'd definitely appreciate any feedback to make the code even better, concise or functional. 
 The only additional module used was the csv library to parse the .csv log files efficiently - aside from that all the code is regular Python. For an appropriate development environment, I used a virtual environment on my local machine to code this assignment and made appropriate commits to GitHub with explanations behind each commit.
