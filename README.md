 Quantcast Coding Assignment
 
 Hello! I appreciate the time you are taking to review my code and I'd definitely appreciate any feedback to make the code better, more concise or functional. 
 The only additional module used was the csv module to parse the .csv log files efficiently - aside from that all the code is regular Python. For an appropriate development environment, I used a virtual environment on my local machine to code this assignment and made appropriate commits to GitHub with explanations behind each coding-related commit. 
 
Quick note regarding input: For python, I'm using the standard Python commands to get input from the user. Therefore there is a prompt for the input in which the input is entered.


Example on how input is entered:

Enter command here: ./most_active_cookie cookie_log.csv -d 2018-12-08
